snap the object to the nearest point that matches the criteria. To activate or change the snap increments, go to the Edit Menu, Snap Tool Settings.

window opening to the east, you may need only one west-facing wall in the 
Infinite Background to show a scene through that window. If you have a skylight, 
perhaps a single ceiling will suffice for an Infinite Background. For an outdoor

<H4>Adding actions</H4>
<P CLASS="four">To add actions to a sequence, find the sequence in the Hierarchy Tree and 
click on its Components. This List will initially be empty. Click the Add 
button and add previously created actions into your sequence, one at a time (when the Add to Components box comes up, click on the downward-pointing triangle to the right of the first listed action.  This will reveal a list of all the actions you have previously created). Note that you should try to add items to the 
sequence in the exact order they will run. When you Add another action to the 
list, it will always add to the last position, there is no insertion point! 
However, you can Delete from any point in the List. You can overcome the 
no-insertion-point problem slightly by careful use of Cut and Undo, because you 
can Cut from anywhere in the list but Undo will always place the action last in 
the list. </P>
<A name=sq4></A>
<H4>Synchronization issues: Multithreading</H4>
<P CLASS="four">Another problem you might run into with sequences is that each item in the 
sequence's Components needs to finish executing before the next item can begin. 
This has the following unfortunate consequences: </P>
<UL CLASS="four">
  <LI>You shouldn't put an infinitely looping action into a sequence, because 
  that action will never complete itself. In theory you could put an infinitely 
  looping action as the LAST thing that happens in a sequence, but then WorldsShaper 
  has to deal with the overhead of two things running constantly: the looping 
  action and a sequence that it can't close. 
  <LI>You can't use a single sequence to synchronize two things to happen at 
  exactly the same time. For instance, if your sequence had a Move action that 
  made a door open and then a Sound action that played the sound of a door 
  opening, the door would open all the way, stop, and only then would the sound 
  be played. The way around this particular problem is to have one sensor 
  trigger two different sequences, one containing all the Sounds and one 
  containing all the Moves. You would also have to factor in the times that the 
  sounds and moves themselves take to figure out the ultimate timing of each 
  sequence, especially when trying to synchronize the sequences to each other. 
  Sometimes you won't need a sequence at all, you just need to have one sensor 
  trigger multiple actions, in which case the actions will start as close to 
  simultaneously as is possible. </LI></UL>
<P><A name=sq5></A></P>
<H4>Wait</H4>
<P CLASS="four">Because of the multithreading issues and also for general utility, you will 
frequently be placing Wait actions into your sequences. Wait actions are another 
case of an action that can be owned by just about anything. A good practice is 
to have all the wait actions for your world placed inside some easy-to-find 
object like the first room's Actions list. Remember that you can share the same 
wait action for several different sequences but if you change the timing by 
double-clicking the Wait in any given sequence you'll be changing the "master", 
not a copy. You might create a library of several commonly used units of time in 
progressively larger steps, for example .2 seconds, 1 second, 5 seconds, 30 
seconds. Then you can always insert 2 1-second waits to substitute for having to 
make a whole new 2-second-long wait action from scratch someplace, and you can 
avoid clutter in the list whenever you add an Action. </P>
<P><A name=sq6></A></P>
<H4>Editing actions from within a sequence</H4>
<P CLASS="four">You can click on any action within a sequence to make changes to its properties listed in the Properties Box if you'd like. But again, remember that you are really just taking a "shortcut" to 
where that action really exists, and if you edit an action in a sequence, the 
changes you make will show up in every other sequence that uses that action, as 
well as in the action's "master" back in whatever object it's owned by. However, 
if you Delete an item from a sequence, you won't be deleting the "master", just 
a copy, and clicking the Owner button after double-clicking an action in a 
sequence will take you back up to the sequence, not to the action's real owner. 
</P>
<P><A name=sq7></A></P>
<H4>Sequences within sequences</H4>
<P CLASS="four">Since a sequence is itself an action, there's no reason why you can't nest 
other sequences inside a larger sequence. Just keep in mind that the entirety of 
the nested sequence needs to be executed before the next item in the larger 
sequence's list can be started. And don't make the mistake of putting a sequence 
inside itself! We make no guarantees about what will happen in this case. </P>
<HR>

<P><A name=Animate></A></P>
<H3>Animate</H3>
<P CLASS="three">Animate places bitmaps on an object and cycles through them in a specified 
linear sequence. You can apply an animation to objects like walls that take a 
Materials property for textures, but you won't be able to "animate" a Shape in 
this way, because a Shape's textures are stored internally. If you just want to 
move a Shape through space (or a wall for that matter), you'll want to use the 
<A href="#Move">Move 
action</A> instead. </P>
<P CLASS="three">Tiling is the same as the Material that existed on the wall before you start 
the animation. For instance, if you have tiled a wall to repeat its texture four 
times horizontally (250,0 tiling on a 1000-wide wall) any animation you attach 
to the wall will also tile four across. For this reason you might want to attach 
animations to separate rects rather than to architectural walls of a room. </P>
<H4>Specific properties of Animate</H4>
<UL CLASS="four">
  <LI><B>Cycle time</B> <BR>Type the total time the animation should take, in 
  milliseconds (default is "1000" or 1 second). The display time for each frame becomes this number divided by 
  the number of frames.

<HR>

<H3><A name=Gravity></A>Gravity</H3>
<P CLASS="three">When the Gravity action is triggered, it will pull users (their camera) to a specified point in the room.  
There is no escaping a Gravity action - no matter where you are in a room, if you trigger it, you will move to the designated point.  When a Gravity action is applied to a wall, the user's camera will be pulled to the lower left corner of the wall (where the red dot is when the wall is selected).  Since the camera height for avatars is set at 150, the user would sink into the floor until its "eye height" was at the lower left corner.  Since this probably isn't the desired effect, what you need to do is create a copy of the wall to attach the gravity action to. For example, if you wanted the Gravity action to carry you to the center of a room, you would first make a copy of a wall. Attach the Gravity Action to the copied wall. Make the copied wall 1 pixel high and one pixel wide, and position it at 500,500,150 (assuming a default 1000x1000 room).  Now when the Gravity action is triggered, the user will be pulled to the center of the room.</P>

<H4>Specific properties of Gravity:</H4>

<P CLASS="three">Move replaces the old-style behaviors that don't have sensors, like Spin and 
Post-spin, and also allows you to dynamically move objects through space. For 
instance, you can use the Move action to spin a door rectangle on its z axis to 
make it look like it is swinging closed, or to make a ball appear to roll across 
the floor instead of just spinning in place. </P>

<P CLASS="three">All Move actions take place around or from a point on any given object that 
usually its bottom left corner for rects or an approximate center for a Shape. 
But some objects that you've added, particularly default walls and 
floors/ceilings, may already have a transform applied to them. For instance, a 
floor is really just a wall pitched over 90 degrees, and a West wall is really 
an East wall with a 180 degree rotation , so the initial position may not be 
what you expect in an absolute coordinate sense. As a result, it can often take 
some experimenting to get the Move action to do what you want. You may have to 
flip objects upside down or turn them around to get the origin in the right 
place for your particular move action. Look for the red dot in any given object: 
that dot will be the origin around which move actions will take place. </P>
<P CLASS="three">There are essentially two ways to establish a Move action: a playback/record

other objects in the room. Most often a SameRoom sensor is used to trigger the RemotePortal action. You could however use a
Startup or other sensor to change the point in time where the user will "take 
the hit" of having to stop and load a <TT>.WORLD</TT> file into memory, 
potentially as a download. Or you could put the SameRoom Sensor in a different

the user's local hard drive bundled with the world.</P>
 
<P CLASS="three">For URL's ending with any other extension, the URL will be passed as-is to Windows Media Player, which will attempt to play the URL
given.  You could in this manner point to streaming audio for example.  Unfortunately, since Windows Media Player can't interpret Worlds'
home:/ URL's, you can't specify local files in a sound action other than wav or midi files, since Windows Media Player doesn't know where
the world was installed on the user's hard drive.  This is a known limitation that we hope to resolve, in order to allow things like playing
MP3 files and other new audio formats that come along.</P>
 
<P CLASS="three">The Music Manager (in the Options menu of the WorldsPlayer Interface), used primarily for room-based background music, works similarly.  .WAV and .MID files are processed by Worlds

can.</P>

  <LI><B>Max Volume:</B> This is set to a default of 1. You can think of 1 being 
  about 100%, but since sound volumes are always variable depending on speakers, 
  volume of the source sound and other intangibles, you should experiment with 
  different levels here to get the desired effect. You can set Max Volume very 
  high, to numbers like 500 or more, but you are risking blowing out your 
  speakers if this sound gets triggered while you are close by, or at least 
  you'll get a nasty surprise! Ideally this should be set below 1.0, otherwise 
  thre is the potential for distortion. If your sound is still too low-level try 
  raising the level in the soundfile itself by editing the<TT> .WAV</TT> file. 
  If you don't have a good <TT>.WAV</TT> editor, <A

  <LI><B>Stop Distance: </B>Defines the range in which the sound can be heard. 
  If Attenuate With Distance is set to True (the default), the sound will be 
  maximum volume when you are standing next to it, and the sound will fall off 
  gradually as you move away. At the Stop Distance, the sound level will finally 
  be zero. The attenuation is linear relative to distance from the object. 
  <LI><B>Times to Repeat:</B>Equivalent to the Loop property of many other 
  actions. Once triggered, this sound will play that many times in a row. 
  Setting to -1 will make the sound loop endlessly until you exit the World. 
  <LI><B>Attenuate with Distance: </B>Can be set to True or False. If you set it 
  to False, the sound won't fall off as you move away but will cut off abruptly 
  at the Stop Distance. 
  <LI><B>Do panning: </B>If Do Panning is set to True, the sound will be louder 
  through the right speaker if it's off to your right, louder in the left if 
  it's left of you, and that sound will generally behave "in stereo". If Do 
  Panning is set to False, that sound will be "mono" and won't change relatively 
  left or right, but will diminish with distance to the same degree in both 
  speakers if you set Attenuate with Distance to True. 
  <LI><B>Room Hops til sound dies<BR></B>Room Hops let you "carry" a sound with 
  you from room to room as you pass through portals. Each number above one 
  carries the sound through that many rooms; if you set it to 2, you can hear 
  the sound in two rooms, after having passed through one portal. If you go 
  through a second portal, into a third room, the sound stops. The volume falls 
  off with distance from the original sound in each case, by two different 
  algorithms (see below). Also make sure to read about <A

  they went the "short way", as if whatever walls the rooms might have had in 
  between don't block out sound (Door Based Audibility = False). This affects 
  the volume you will hear the sound at because the two distances will typically 
  result in two different proximity-based volume levels. See the diagram below: 
  <BR>The red line indicates a distance path for Door Based Audibility = True, 
  the blue line is a distance path for Door Based Audibility = False. <B>Note: </B>for Door Based Audibility = 
  False, the two rooms are lined up against each other so that the geographies 
  make relative sense, based on which portal you entered from. A side effect is 
  if you have multiple room hops between two rooms connected to each other by 
  more than one portal things can get a littlke strange. </LI></UL>

<H3><B>Click Sensor</B></H3>

  <P CLASS="three">A Click Sensor triggers its target whenever the user clicks anywhere on the 
  object's bounding box. There are several parameters you can adjust in addition 
  to the name: Left Button, Right Button, Center Button and Wait for Upclick. 
  Setting any of the first three to True enables that type of mouse-click to 
  trigger the target action. If you set multiple buttons to True, the 
  relationship is an OR relationship, as in either the left or right button 
  could trigger the action, does not require both to be pressed together. Wait 
  for Upclick won't perform the target action until the depressed mouse button 
  is released (applies to any enabled mouse button).</P>
  
<H4>Click sensor limitations and considerations</H4>
<UL class="four">
  <LI>If an object has been declared to be Invisible, you cannot click it, so an 
  invisible object 's click sensor will be inactive until that object becomes 
  visible again. 
  <LI>Note that a lot of mouse-handling information is affected by an 
  individual's Windows setup. If there's too much time between downclick and 
  upclick, WorldsShaper won't even register the upclick, so use Wait for Upclick=True 
  with caution. 
  <LI>If you're actively building a world, right-clicking an object will always 
  bring up the properties box, in addition to whatever click sensor activity you 
  may have assigned. This limits the usefulness of right-click triggering until 
  you have disabled WorldsShaper functionality. 
  <LI>You can left-click through portals, but you can't right-click through 
  them, because you will be selecting the portal and opening its Properties box. 

  <LI>Many objects have bounding boxes that are shaped differently than you 
  might expect, and it is the bounding box that detects being clicked. The 
  bounding box can be viewed when you right-click an object; it's the thin white 
  rectangle that appears around the object. In particular, Shapes 
  have bounding boxes that can extend well out from the visible portion of the 
  object. </LI></UL>
  
  <HR>
<H3><A name=BumpS></A>Bump</H3>

  <P CLASS="three">Bump triggers its target action whenever the user bumps into that object. 
  The definition of what it means to be bumped for each object is handled by its 
  bump calculator. For a Rect like a wall, that pretty much corresponds to how 
  the bounding box appears when you right-click it. For a Shape, it's an 
  approximate and slightly larger box that goes completely around the Shape and 
  always faces your avatar as a perpendicular vertical plane.</P>
  <P CLASS="three">For almost all objects except a Portal, the bump calculator also performs 
  collision detection, meaning that you can bump into that object but you cannot 
  penetrate it. Bump calculation only affects the relationship between your 
  avatar and objects, not objects and other objects. You can superimpose two 
  objects when you're building them and neither one will care. You can turn off 
  all collision detection and bumpability in an object, and that will enable you 
  to walk right through it, but it will also disable any Bump sensor that object 
  may contain.</P>
  <P CLASS="three">Portals do bump calculation, but in a different way. If you bump (pass 
  through) a portal, all sorts of things go on in the background where WorldsShaper 
  removes your avatar from the room you came from and adds it to the new room. 
  This happens by default, and you don't even see a Bump trigger inside a portal 
  that's involved in making this happen. But a portal is unique in that it 
  registers a Bump event <I>yet still allows an avatar to walk through it.</I> 
  You can use this feature to your advantage by adding a Bump sensor to the 
  portal and using portals as invisible "trip-wire" triggers. See the section on <A HREF="#portaltrigger">using 
  a Portal as an invisible but bumpable trigger</A>.</P>
  
  <H4>Bump limitations and considerations</H4>
<UL class="four">
  <LI>Note that if you pass through a Rect from its non-drawing side, you will 
  not produce a Bump event. 
  <LI>If you bash into a wall, there is no built-in rebound. If your avatar is 
  stuck to a wall that has a Bump trigger, that wall will continue to send Bump 
  events each frame until you back away from the wall. 
  <LI>As with the Click sensor, the area that produces a Bump event from a Shape 
 can often be much larger than the Shape appears to be. 
  <LI>Bump events are actually caused by the intersection of your avatar's bump 
  calculator with any other object's bump calculator. Your own avatar has a 
  box-shaped bump calculator much like a Shape does. In the vertical (z) 
  direction, with a default avatar and the default camera height of 120, your 
  avatar will produce Bump events in objects above z=30 and below z=140. Objects 
  less than 30 in height don't register bump events because otherwise you 
  couldn't properly use stairs. Objects whose bottoms are above z = 140 are 
  considered to be "on the ceiling" and don't impede your forward progress. Your 
  default avatar is considered to be approximately 70 WorldsShaper units wide and deep, 
  though you can sometimes squeeze through gaps as small as 60 wide depending on 
  your facing relative to blocking objects. 
  <LI>The above does not hold true for portals. You do not trigger a portal Bump 
  event or make it swap you from one room to the next, until your avatar's 
  center intersects the portal plane. </LI></UL>
  
  <H4><A name=portaltrigger></A>Using a portal as an invisible but bumpable 
trigger</H4>
<P CLASS="four">The Bump trigger only 
works when the object is bumpable, and when you make something unbumpable such 
that you can pass right through it, the Bump sensor no longer registers a 
BumpEvent and the trigger does nothing! </P>
<P CLASS="four">There's a way around this, particularly 
for triggering doors so that they open while still in your viewpoint instead of 
slamming in your face. The only objects that will register a Bump event and 
still allow people to pass through are Portals. Portals have two other important 
advantages as trigger objects. They are unidirectional, so you can set up pairs 
of portals to trigger different actions on the way in or out of a room. They can 
also be set to invisible, so until you select them you'll never know they are 
there. </P>
<P CLASS="four">The portals you use as trigger objects don't need to be hooked up to other 
portals or allow viewpoints into other rooms. In fact, you'll want to leave all 
these properties empty in most cases, or you'll slow down the framerate trying 
to reproduce the viewpoint. You're probably going to want an invisible portal in 
most cases anyway. </P>
<H4>Instructions for setting up a trigger portal</H4>
<P CLASS="four">For this example, let's assume you've already created a Rectangle doorway 
object that swings aside when triggered, and reveals a Portal to another room 
behind it. The swinging motion can be accomplished with a Move action.</P>
<OL class="four">
  <LI>Navigate through the Hierarchy Tree until you're either in the

  door you want to trigger, pick the Portal that's 180 degrees opposite of your

<P CLASS="four">Remember that if you want the door to close properly, you have to put a 
portal coming the opposite direction or put a sequence together that closes the 
door after a certain time. For a fully working door that opens and closes from 
both sides, you'll need 2 pairs of portals, one on each side. One of the pair 
controls a door's opening action, the other faces 180 degrees opposite in the 
same spot and controls the door's separately defined closing action. If your 
door has sound, you can use the same trigger portal to trigger the sound or a 
sequence containing sounds. </P>

<LI>You'll notice, however, that the room and objects are not truly "mirrored".  Under Portal Properties, double-click <B>Mirrored</B> and select the "mirrored" option to designate this property as true. </LI>
<LI>VERY IMPORTANT - if you leave the mirror as is, you can walk through the mirror with some very strange results - you'll end up walking on the ceiling of the next room, the right arrow key will make you turn left, the left arrow key will make you turn right,  and you won't be able to walk out of this upsidedown room! Assuming you don't want this effect, you'll need to do the following steps:</LI>
<OL class="two">
<LI>Make the portal unbumpable (make the Bumpable property = false).</LI>
<LI>Place a rect of the same size directly over the portal.</LI>
<LI>Either make the rect's Visible property = false, or add a "frame" by adding a texture to the rect that has transparency in the center.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<p>NOTE:  It's not a good idea to put mirrors facing each other.  Although possible, it's not advised since this will slow your world down considerably due to the number of "reflections" WorldsPlayer will be forced to render.</p>

<P class="two">The interactive walls in the Gallery of Metamorphics contain a "Wear Wall" which allows small samples of avatar textures/heads/faces to be displayed for the user to choose from.  The following instructions are specifically for the walls in the Gallery of Metamorphics (use these for reference), but they can be adapted as far as size and placement.</P>

<P class="two">
These instructions are based on having the following 6 textures:<br>

</P>
<br><br>
<ol class="two">

<li>From the Objects Library, add a Wear Wall to your room.  Make it 125w x 250h, and set its Color to 255,252,235 (under Material Properties). NOTE: a Wear Wall can be any size.  The size of the textures (or heads or faces) that display on the wall will depend on 1.) the size of the Wear Wall and 2.) the number of textures/heads/faces that have to fit on the wall.</li>
<li>Add a <b>SetString Action</b> to the Wear Wall.  Name it SetStringAction1.</li>
<li>For the titles above the Wear Wall, create a rect above the Wear Wall that is 125w x 25h.  Set the tiling on this rect to 0,125 and the tile origin to 0,-25.</li>
<li>Add an <b>Animate Action</b> to this top rect, naming it AnimateAction1.  Set the AnimateAction's Cycle Time to 0, and its Cycles to 1.</li>
<li>Add 3 rects to the left of the Wear Wall, one at the top that is 125x125, another 125x125 rect below that, and a 125x25 rect on the bottom (make the color of this bottom one 160,181,255).</li>
<li>Add the vancat5t.mov texture to the top rect on the left.</li>
<li>Add the vancat5b.mov texture to the middle rect on the left.</li>
<li>Add a <b>WearAction</b> to the top rect, naming it WearAction1.  Set the WearAction's Limb to Q.</li>
<li>Add a <b>ClickSensor</b> to the top rect (vancat5t), and in its targets add WearAction1, SetStringAction1, and AnimateAction1.  Set the ClickSensor's config file to "Top.clk", and store the Top.clk file in the same directory as your .world file (see below for more info on .clk files).</li>
<li>Add a <b>ClickSensor</b> to the middle rect (vancat5b) and in its targets add SetStringAction1 and AnimateAction1.  Set the ClickSensor's config file to "Bottom.clk" and store the Bottom.clk file (see below) in the same directory as your .world file.</li>
</ol>
<H3>.CLK Files</H3>
<P class="three">Within your WorldsShaper directory, look in the AvatarGallery folder (if you have that world installed) to see the Top.clk and Bottom.clk files.  Open them in Notepad and you'll see that there are a list of coordinates for each of the "buttons" on the textures to the left of the Wear Wall.  Each button has textures, colors, or heads assigned to it, and each button calls up a different "title" above the Wear Wall (see the Frame List within the .clk files). Below is a more detailed description of each line.</P>

<p class="three">
We'll use Top.clk from the AvatarGallery folder for reference:<br><br>

<tt>43 256 256</tt><br><b>Line1:</b> The top three numbers in the file are the number of lines in the file (43) and the size of the texture this file references (256 256).  Top.clk references vancat5t.mov
<br><br>


Each button on vancat5t.mov uses three lines in the .clk file: <br><br>
<tt>103 202 65 21 SetString "Property Name" Limb "Set To" H</tt><br>
<b>Line 2:</b> The four numbers represent the coordinates of the button on vancat5t. The lower left corner of the vancat5t texture is 0,0, and <tt>103 202</tt> is the x,y coordinate of the lower left corner of the "Male Heads" button. <tt>Limb "Set To" H</tt> tells the program that the head (H) texture will change if this button is clicked.<br><br>
<tt>103 202 65 21 SetString "Property Name" "Tile List" "Set To" "axel cassius charlie ..."</tt><br>
<b>Line 3:</b> Here you list the <tt>"Tile List"</tt>, that is, the textures you want to display when a user clicks on this button.  In this instance the list of textures contains <tt> axel cassius charlie dude guru</tt> etc. which tells the Wear Wall to display these "head" files when a user clicks on the "Male Heads" button.<br><br>
<tt>103 202 65 21 Animate "Frame List" heads1s*.mov</tt><br>
<b>Line 4: </b> This line tells the program which title to display above the Wear Wall (colors1, colors2, head, or faces.mov).  In this instance, <tt>heads1s*.mov</tt> is listed, which means "display the first frame of the heads.mov file".  If you want a different frame to display, replace the <tt>1</tt> within <tt>heads1s*.mov</tt> with whatever frame number you desire.<br><br>
<b>Lines 5,6,7:</b> These next three lines are for the Male Faces button.  You'll notice that the coordinates change, as do the <tt>Limb</tt> (E for "face"), and the list of frames (<tt>ztx cassius charlie dude</tt> etc.)<br><br>
<tt>12 20 23 31 Wear Value qqq</tt><br>
<b>Line 37:</b> At the bottom of this .clk file, you'll notice that the last 7 lines are different than the others.  These refer to the "Head Size" buttons at the bottom of vancat5t.mov.  The first four numbers are again the coordinates of that particular head size button.  Then the <tt>Wear Value</tt> of <tt>qqq</tt> tells the program to shrink the avatar's head to that size.  <tt>000</tt> is the "normal" head size (see Line 40).

<H2><A name=distribution></A>How to Register Your World</H2>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you have enough web space available to you (through your ISP) to hold all of the files associated with your world.  
 
<li>Verify the links to textures and shapes.  Serving your new world is very much like serving a web page.  Your .world file is like the html file that points to various images, except it
instead points to 3D textures and shapes.  As with an html file, you should go back and make sure you aren't linking to objects directly on your hard drive. Within your world, all of the URL's to textures and objects should begin with the "rel:" prefix (in most cases this is added to the URL for you by WorldsShaper).  For example:<br><br>

CORRECT texture URL:  <br><br><tt>rel:file:c:/WorldsShaper/MyWorld/textures/grass.gif</tt><br><br>
INCORRECT texture URL:  <br><br><tt>file:c:/WorldsShaper/MyWorld/textures/grass.gif</tt><br><br>

 This is the same as absolute and relative URL's on a web page and carries the same problems... if your links point directly to your hard drive instead of a relative path from the .world file, your world won't work for anybody but you.

<li>Verify the proper case on all uploaded
files. The filenames of any images or shapes in your world will become
case-sensitive when uploaded to a server.  
 
<li>Ensure that you haven't compressed any resources into content.zip files.  While this will work locally on your machine, WorldsPlayer
can't decompress ZIP files on web servers.  If you don't know what that means, pretend step 4 didn't exist.
 
<li>FTP all of the files associated with your world to your web space.  Be sure to preserve whatever directory structure your world had.  For example, if your .world file is within your WorldsShaper directory on your hard drive, like this:
<br><br>
<img src="images/dir.gif" width="129" height="67" border="0" alt=""><br><br>

then keep that same file structure when you upload all of your files.

<li>Determine the URL to your .world file; this will be used in a creating a WorldsMark to your world and telling other users how to access
your world.  Again, it's just like an html file.  For example:<br><br>
<tt>http://www.myisp.net/JoesAccount/MyWorld/Joes.world</tt><br><br>


<li>Create a WorldsMark for your new world by clicking on <b>WorldsMark</b> on the WorldsPlayer interface.  Choose <b>Add new WorldsMark...</b>. In the Add WorldsMark box, type in the name of your world, and in the URL section put your world's URL:<br><br>

<tt>http://www.myisp.net/JoesAccount/MyWorld/Joes.world</tt><br><br>

Then click <b>Add...</b>.<br><br>

<li><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: You must be off-line in Worlds (not signed in) to do this step. Once your world has been registered, you will be able to access it while signed-in.</b><br><br> Click on WorldsMark again, and use the WorldsMark you just created to teleport to your world. You should see your world form around you as its resources are downloaded, starting in the room
your avatar is in.  Any textures or shapes that don't come in may be absolute links to your hard drive... go back and check for that.

<li>Register your world by going to <a href="http://dev.worlds.net/cgi-bin/shaper/submit_world.pl">http://dev.worlds.net/cgi-bin/shaper/submit_world.pl</a>.  Fill out the form, including your WorldShaper account number.  At the bottom of the form, you can choose to have your world published on our User Created Worlds page, or you can have your world be unpublished (your world will still be registered, it just won't be published on our web page).  Click on the Submit button.  It will take a few days for the authorization process, and Worlds will let you know via email when your world has been registered.  
 
<li>Give the URL for your world to all your friends, and tell them to make a WorldsMark with it! <b>NOTE: The URL to your world will not work for others until it has been registered with Worlds, unless they wish to view your world while off-line.</b>
